# AnimatedH2Divs
A **jQuery** script and some **CSS** styles that do and undo H2 animations according to the scrolling of the screen.

How to use it:
1. Wrap each **H2** heading you want to animate in a **DIV** with the class **"animated-h2-div"**.
2. Define the **height of the screen** in which the animation must happen in the method **"screenAnimationPoint"**, in the class **AnimatedH2Divs.js**.
3. Use transitions to define the **animation** you want to happen in the file **style.css**.
